# Advanced Machine Learning - Project 2 - Caenorhabditis elegans roundworms classification and prediction

Caenorhabditis elegans roundworms classification and prediction using multiple data representations and ARIMA model (for Advanced Machine Learning course).
Includes initial data exploration, data cleaning, and multiple data representation methods (Piecewise Aggregate Approximation; DFT).
Multiple Machine Learning models are leveraged to extract the best classification possible (KNN; Random Forests; Hidden Markov Models; K-Means).
ARIMA modelling for worm prediction.
